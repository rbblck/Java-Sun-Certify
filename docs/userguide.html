                The Bodgitt and Scarper Contractor Booking System application will help 
                the Customer Service Representative (CRS) take requests from home owners 
                for a type of service and offer the homeowner one or more Contractors 
                that can provide the required services. Once the Contractor with the 
                desired services has been found, the CSR can then book the Contractor 
                with the Customers eight digit Customer number.

                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two ways to run the Bodgitt and Scarper booking system 
                application:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In Stand Alone mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Network Mode.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                For both modes please change your current working directory to 
                the directory you have installed the application before executing 
                commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specific instructions to start the application in both modes follow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        In Stand Alone Mode
                    </strong>					
                    In stand-alone mode, you will only need to start one JVM to 
                    run the application as the server is not used in this mode.<br />
					<br />
                    Once in the installed directory, runs the following command 
                    (using the “alone” flag):<br />
					<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar runme.jar alone</code><br />
					<br />
                    The Application will now present a frame allowing you to state the 
                    location of the database.  For more information on this see the 
                    ”Select the Database Location at start up” section 2.<br />
					<br />
              </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        In Network Mode<br />
					    <br />
                    </strong>					
                    In network mode, you will need to start the server in one JVM and 
                    the client in another JVM.  The JVM’s can be on the same computer 
                    or different computers connected through a network.<br />
					<br />
                    First you will need to start the server in the first JVM.  To do 
                    this, once in the installed directory, run the following command 
                    (using the “server” flag):<br />
					<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar runme.jar server</code><br />
					<br />
                    The server will now presents a frame allowing you to state the 
                    location of the database and the port that you would like the server 
                    to listen on.  For more information on this see the ”Select the 
                    Database Location at start up” section 2.<br />
					<br />
                    Second you will need to start the network client in the second JVM.  
                    To do this, once in the installed directory, run the following 
                    command (using no flag):<br />
					<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar runme.jar</code><br />
					<br />
                    The client will now presents a frame allowing you to state the 
                    location of the server which in turn has the location of the database 
                    and the port that you would like the client to connect on.  For more 
                    information on this see the ”Select the Database Location at start up” 
                    section 1.

                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                When the application first starts up you are presented with a 
                configuration window. The configuration window will require you to 
                confirm certain properties that the application needs to read the 
                database, depending on which mode you have started the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    In server mode &quot;server&quot;:<br/>

            </p>
            <blockquote>
                First, you will need to select the location of the database 
                file. You can do this by using the the browse button 
                &quot;...&quot; to the right of the Database Location  
                field.<br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> You must have selected a database 
                file location to be able to start the server.<br />
                <br />
                Second, you will need to enter the port number ranging from 
                1025 and 49152 that you would like the server to listen 
                on.<br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> You must enter the port number before 
                you can start the server. <br />
                <br />
                Once the above has been entered then you can start the 
                server. The server will start with the entered file 
                location and port number. <br />
                <br />
                To start the server click the &quot;Start Server&quot; 
                Button.<br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> You now can not change any of the 
                information you have entered.  If you whish to change the 
                information you have entered, you must click the &quot;Stop 
                Server&quot; button, re-enter the information and click 
                &quot;Start Server&quot; again to restart the server.

                First, you will need to enter the location of the database

                address or &quot;localhost&quot;<br />
                <br />
                Second, you will then have to enter the port number that 
                the server is listening on.<br />
                <br />
                Once the above has been entered you can connect to the 
                server by clicking the &quot;Confirm&quot; button and the 
                Network Client will start.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> If you do not enter the correct 
                server address and port number, the connection will fail and 
                you will have to restart the client application again.

                <strong>Note:</strong> If the file is not found or it is the

                will have to restart the stand alone application again.

            </p>
            <p>
                You can search the data for all records by not entering any search 
                criteria, or for records where the name and/or location fields 
                exactly match your entries. If any if the fields are left empty the 
                search will match the other non-empty field exactly disregarding 
                the empty field and returning all records only matching the non-empty

            </p>
            <p>
                To book a contractor with a customer number:
            </p>
            <p>
                You must first search for a list of contractors using the search 
                operation in step 2 so a display table is shown with a list of 
                Contractors to choose from.<br />

                process.<br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> If a contractor has been booked while you are 
                in the process of booking a message will be shown and the list will 
                refresh showing the current status of all your searched contractors. 
                If this occurs you will have to book another contractor or abort the 
                operation.<br />
                <br />
          </p>
            <p>
                After you have clicked the &quot;Book&quot; button, another window 
                will open and with the selected contractor details, check the 
                details, enter the customer eight digit number and click the 
                &quot;Book&quot; button to book the contractor.<br />
                <strong>Note: </strong>The system will not accept anything but an 
                    eight digit customer number.<br />

                Once the contractor is booked, a conformation message will appear 
                indicating the booking operation has been completed successfully. 
                Also the display table will be updated to reflect your booking.
